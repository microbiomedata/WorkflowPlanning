# This is an example of how you can use Docker only workflows as a Cromwell
# backend provider. *This is not a complete configuration file!* The
# content here should be copy pasted into the backend -> providers section
# of the cromwell.examples.conf in the root of the repository. You should
# uncomment lines that you want to define, and read carefully to customize
# the file. If you have any questions, please open an issue at
# https://www.github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/issues

# Documentation
# This backend doesn't have an official page, but you can read about general
# Docker use here: https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/tutorials/Containers/#docker
# If you want to use containers, the other sections on that page will be useful to you.
